(THERE ARE SAMPLE INPUT AND OUTPUT IN SUBMISSION FOLDER. OUTPUT IMAGE NAME CLEARLY MENTION WHAT OPERATION IS APPLIED ON THEM)

1. To run the program for this assignment go to folder and type following on terminal:
	for filters:
		"python frequency_filters.py standard_test_images/[Image_Name]"
		
2. You will get 4 options for first part of assingment: (edge detection) 
	Press 1 to  apply Low Pass Filter to the image: ____[Enter]
	       Press Enter for default cutoff frequency fraction [3dB(.707 of maximum)]: 
	       Type cutoff frequency fraction, if not default  :
	Press 2 to apply High Pass Filter to the image :
		Press Enter for default cutoff frequency fraction [3dB(.707 of maximum)]: 
		Type cutoff frequency fraction, if not default  :
	Press 3 to apply Band Pass to the  image :
		Press Enter for default cutoff frequency fraction [3dB(.707 of maximum)]: 
		Type lower cutoff frequency fraction, if not default  :
													____Enter
		Type upper cutoff frequency fraction, if not default  : 
													____Enter
		Press Enter to exit:							____Enter

3. After saving the image it will show output and ask for rerun the program:
		Press 'q' to quit  : 
		Press Enter to run again:                                               ____Enter
	
4. go to standard_test_images_Frequency_Filter to see filtered images. In this folder images has extension about what operation is done on them (with paramters)	
	a. for Low Pass Filter filter: _Low_Pass_[cutoff]
	b. for High Pass Filter filter: _High_Pass_[cutoff]
	c. for Band Pass Filter filter: _Band_Pass_Lower_[cutoff_Lower]_Upper_[cutoff_Upper]
