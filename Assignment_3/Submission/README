----------------------------------------README for Assigment 3-----------------------------------

(THERE ARE SAMPLE INPUT AND OUTPUT IN SUBMISSION FOLDER. OUTPUT IMAGE NAME CLEARLY MENTION WHAT OPERATION IS APPLIED ON THEM)

1. To run the program for this assignment go to folder and type following on terminal:
	to add noise:
		"python add_noise.py standard_test_images/[Image_Name]"
	to apply filters:
		"python filters.py standard_test_images_Noise/[Noisy_Image_Name]"
		
2. You will get 2 options for first part of assingment: (adding the noise) 
	Press 1 to  add gaussain noise ____[Enter]
		type mean for noise ___ [Enter] (generally 0)
		type variance for noise ___ [Enter] (e.g. 441)
	Press 2 to  add salt and pepper noise   ___  [Enter]
		type % of noise you want to add  ___  [Enter]
	Press Enter to exit
3. go to standard_test_images_Noise_ folder to see noisy images. In Noise folder images has extension about what operation is done on them (with paramters)	
4. You will get 2 options for second part of assingment: (applying the filter) 
	Press 1 to  apply Rotating Average Mask Filter ____[Enter]
		type height of  mask window ___ [Enter] (e.g. 3)
		type width of mask window ___ [Enter] (e.g. 3)
	Press 2 to  apply Median Mask Filter   ___  [Enter]
		type height of  mask window ___ [Enter] (e.g. 3)
		type width of mask window ___ [Enter] (e.g. 3)
	Press Enter to exit
5. go to standard_test_images_Noise_Output folder to modified image. In ouput folder images has extension about what operation is done on them
	a. For Roataing Average Mask Filter: _RotatingAverageFilter_NXM
	a. For Median Mask Filter: _MedianFilter_NXM
