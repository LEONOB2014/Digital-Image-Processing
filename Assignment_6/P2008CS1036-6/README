(THERE ARE SAMPLE INPUT AND OUTPUT IN SUBMISSION FOLDER. OUTPUT IMAGE NAME CLEARLY MENTION WHAT OPERATION IS APPLIED ON THEM)

1. To run the program for this assignment go to folder and type following on terminal:
	for filters:
		"python segmentation.py standard_test_images/[Image_Name]"
		
2. This will run the program and will show the output of segmentation.  5 images shown are as follows:
	a. Original one:
	b. Segmented for red spectrum:
	c. Segmented for green spectrum:
	d. Segmented for red spectrum:
	e. Ovelap of b,c and d in edge format using roberts operator:
3. After saving the image it will show output and ask for rerun the program:
		Press 'q' to quit  : 
		Press Enter to run again:                                               ____Enter
	
4. go to standard_test_images_Segmented to see segmented images. In this folder images has extension about what operation is done on them (with paramters)	
	For each images there are 4 images created. Therefor we have created a separate folder for the purpose having extension _Segmented
	a. for red spectrum segmentation: _Segmented_red
	b. for green spectrum segmentation: _Segmented_green
	c. for blue spectrum segmentation: _Segmented_blue
	d. for overlap of all: _Segmented_rgb
	e. one more file is created to save the figure shown after running the program but it is not saving it properly so it is empty: _Segmented_all
