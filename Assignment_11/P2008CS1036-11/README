----------------------------------------README for Assigment 11-----------------------------------

(THERE ARE SAMPLE INPUT AND OUTPUT IN SUBMISSION FOLDER. OUTPUT IMAGE NAME CLEARLY MENTION WHAT OPERATION IS APPLIED ON THEM)

1. To run the program for this assignment go to folder and type following on terminal:
	for filters:
		"python AreaUsingChainCode.py standard_test_images/[Image_Name]"
		
2. You will get 3 options as an input to the program: 

	Press 4 for 4-neighbor approach or 8 for 8-neighbor approach[Default 8(Press Enter)]: _____[Enter]
	
	 Want to apply gaussian smoothing, type 1 for yes or 0 for no[Default NO(press Enter)]:  ____[Enter]
	  
	 Type tolerance for region sperating intensity(int) criteria[press Enter for Default (Default is 10)]:   ____[Enter]
	
	  
3. After saving the image it will show output of detected boundaries and ask for rerun the program:
		Press 'q' to quit  : 
		Press Enter to run again:                                               ____Enter
	
4. go to standard_test_images_region_area  to see output images and area calculated . In this folder images has extension about what operation is done on them (with paramters)	
	e.g.  image_neighbor_8_gaussian_smoothing_tolerance_10.0_total_regions_1484_time_taken_3.23228907585_sec.gif
	a. 4/8 neighbor approach is shown 
	b. if gaussian smoothing is applied then it shows gaussain smoothing
	c. show the tolerance value
	d. show the no. of regions detected
	e. show time taken to run the program
	
	Area of regions are written in .txt extension files.
	a. Show the area of regions in a list format. [1st element is 0 always]
